[Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) are an abstraction of storage devices by which persistant storage can be achieved within Kubernetes.

[Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) can be local (on the same [[Node]]) or a reference to data outside of the [[Cluster]]

**Kubernetes does not manage data persistance**
