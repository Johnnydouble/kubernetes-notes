[Kube Proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-proxy) is a network proxy that maintains network rules on nodes to partially impl the service concept.

The network rules it maintains allow network communication both inside and outside of the cluster.

**Note: OS native packet filtering layer will be used if one is available**
